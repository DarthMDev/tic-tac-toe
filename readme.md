First for windows users do these instructions:
install [git](http://git-scm.com/download/win) and make the git commands available to the windows command prompt..

  when you see this:

![git setup image](http://i.gyazo.com/50f6fa4ac05ea7a75c2f5275837e89d1.png)

    pick the 3rd option (available to command prompt plus linux utils)

  when you see:

![git setup image](http://i.gyazo.com/0eeb0f1dded7534ea1c0865bfa1f82e0.png)

    pick the 1st option.. (checkout windows-style, commit unix-style)
After you do these steps open cmd and then cd to your desktop or anywhere you want to put the tic tac toe game in
example :
cd c:\Users\(username)\Desktop
then do these  commands :
git clone https://github.com/MichaelGDev48/tic-tac-toe
git checkout stable
Then run  install_depdencies.command(on mac)
Then run the python msi installer if on windows
then if your on windows run the start-game.bat
if on mac run start-game.command
and thats it :)
